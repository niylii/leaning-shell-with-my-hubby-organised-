Basically, this is my first repository, where you can find the directory that called "00x00-shell_basics". In this directory, I'm trying to learn some shell basics with my supervisor (who is also known as my husband).

Before diving into `command lines`, learning about `SHELL` and some helpful tools (such as the terminal, shortcuts, `wildcards`, etc.) is kind of mandatory because this will definitely make the learning journey much easier.

This directory contains some very important commands for navigation and moving around, like : `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `less`, `file` (with their shortcuts, which we will use frequently later), as well as commands for manipulating files and directories, such as `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`,(with shortcuts, obviously), the directory also includes other commands for documentation, like `man`, `help`, `type`, `which`, and so on.

I have also added some clarifying `commits` that explain the use of each script for each file. I hope they are clear enough. (Also, please ignore any bad grammar in those `commits`, thank you.)
